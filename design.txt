== NPM Scanner ==

The purpose of this library is to perform static analysis on packages
stored in the NPM registry.  The actual analysis will be provided by
the calling application.

The analyzing framework will perform the following steps:

- Does the target directory have a package.json?  If not, then do "npm init".
- Does a package index already exist?  If not, then:
  - Download the JSON document at https://registry.npmjs.org/-/all
  - Create an index of package names.
- Select a package at random from the index which has not been previously
  selected.
- Do "npm install" to fetch the latest version of that package.
- 

== Considerations ==

- Should this library parse the code before calling the user-defined function?
- Some NPM packages are not even javascript at all.  Crazy-pants, I know.
  But we'll need to somehow filter out non-javascript packages.
